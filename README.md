# BigFont-ssd1603
A font for micropython on 128x64 pixel ssd1306 oled display. 

This is a driver for ssd1306 i2c oled displays using micropython. It was written for a Raspberry Pi Pico but should work on any microcontroller running micropython. It was based originally on the ssd1306.py module, but a new, larger font was drawn using framebuffer lines by Nick Mulder. This module is open source, and can be used for free for any purpose.
